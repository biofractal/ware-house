#ware-house angular client#


### What is this repository for? ###

* An AngularJS client to surface and manipulate the resources served by the ware-house API
* The angular SPA is tightly coupled to a dedicated node.js reverse proxy via sockets (no request / response)
* Socketed calls to the proxy are automagically generated by defining RPC style function signatures on the client model
* The proxy is a socket-RPC API (to better describe the business-logic) that composes calls to the strict REST ware-house API (to take advantage of REST principles)

### How do I get set up? ###

* npm -g shelljs
* npm install
* bower install
* npm run build

### Who do I talk to? ###
